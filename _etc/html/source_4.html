	"code" : "S K Physics Body is the class that describes the physics of a node. All the intializers take a parameter such as a radius or a rect. The parameter is used to describe the node collision path. There is also a way to use the node texture alpha channel to generate the collision path. This method is fairly inexpensive however using complex collision paths will lead to performance issues."
