	"code" : "S K Physic Bodies are the class that describe the physic of a node. All the initiations will take a path of sort like a radius or a box size. That is used to describe the node collision path. It also takes part in how mass and density interact in the surface area of the node. There is also a way to use the node texture alpha channel to generate the collision path. The method is very efficient however if the textures have complicated shapes things may slow down."
